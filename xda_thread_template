[QUOTE][QUOTE][FONT="Book Antiqua"][SIZE="5"]Welcome to AxxionPop! While it's been a tough few months developing, we finally managed to release! The two main people working on this are [MENTION=5725382]siracuervo[/MENTION] and @ThatKawaiiGuy (who are both school students), they've both worked their butts off on this, busy with school and their own lives, so we appreciate any sort of positive feedback on the rom. Since we are students and too young to work at any jobs, any sort of donation is appreciated and you can donate through PayPal to [email]AxxionKat@gmail.com[/email]. 

For those who are late to this Axxion party, we released around May last year in Kitkat with the title AxxionKat, we were still beginners in Android development, but this time we're releasing with a few original features such as legacy menu navbar customizations, power menu positions and floating window ported from kitkat with some enhancements and fixes. Very nice work from [MENTION=5725382]siracuervo[/MENTION]. [/SIZE][/FONT][/QUOTE][/QUOTE]
